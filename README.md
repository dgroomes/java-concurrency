# java-concurrency-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring concurrency in Java.


## Standalone subprojects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone subprojects. Each subproject is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone subproject constraint_
forces the subprojects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The subprojects include:


### `virtual-threads/`

A simple demonstration of virtual threads. 

See the README in [virtual-threads/](virtual-threads/).


### `interrupts/`

Learning about interrupts <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/interrupt.html>.

See the README in [interrupts/](interrupts/).


###  `mock-api/`

Run an instance of the excellent HTTP mock server WireMock <http://wiremock.org/docs/>. This subproject only serves as
a vehicle to exercise the concurrency constructs of the other subprojects.

See the README in [mock-api/](mock-api/).   


### `completable-future/`

Learning about `CompletableFuture` <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html>
and related APIs.

See the README in [completable-future/](completable-future/).


### `timer/`

Learning about `java.util.Timer` <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Timer.html>.
and related APIs.

See the README in [timer/](timer/).


### `signals/`

Learning how signals, like `SIGINT`, are handled by a Java program.

See the README in [signals/](signals/).


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Rename `loom` to `virtual-threads`
* [x] DONE Configure `loom/virtual-threads` as a Gradle subproject
* [ ] Upgrade to Gradle 8.5
* [ ] Upgrade to Java 21
